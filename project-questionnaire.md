# Useful things to consider before beginning to design/build products for the web

There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all brief. The questions below will help you to build up a more concise and focused picture as to what your web app/product is all about The answers you give can also be used, alongside further interviews and research, to create a robust **creative** brief that a designer or brand agency would need in order to begin working appropriately. As with any project of this nature, a second **technical** brief would also be required, but this should come only when the initial foundations and ideas are in place.

## General Questions

- Q: What does the product do?
- Q: What is unique about the product?
- Q: What big problem does it aim solve?
- Q: How big is the market opportunity?
- Q: How big can the product get?

## Competition

- Q: Who are your main competitors?
- Q: What gives your product a competitive advantage?
- Q: What advantages does your competition have over you?
- Q: Compared to your competition, how do you intend to compete with respect to features or cost?

## Audience

Note: a useful excercise for defining your audience is to use a UX tool called Personas. Essentially, this comprises the creation of several fake personalities that you feel describe the key types of people who will be interested in your product or services. The questions below will help you to define these people. 

- Q: Who is the product for? (you are not allowed to say 'everyone', perhaps start by considering 3 different people, including yourself if necessary)
- Q: What is their demographic information? (e.g. marital status, age et cetera)
- Q: What is their job and level of seniority?
- Q: What does a day in their life look like?
- Q: What problem(s) do they have that your product will solve?
- Q: What do they value most? (specifically related to industry you will operate in)
- Q: How would you market to these people? OR, where do they go for their information fix?

Now that you've done that...

## Perception/Tone

- Q: How do you want your target audience to respond to your new online presence?
- Q: What do you want them to think and feel?
- Q: How do you imagine the product will help to achieve this goal?
- Q: What adjectives can be used to describe the way the product and company should be perceived?
- Q: What are some specific visual goals the product should convey?
- Q: What 3 words could best describe the look of the product?

## Lastly..

- Q: Where do you want your product to be in 5 years from now? (Time to dream big!)
- Q: Coffee?
